    <h2 class="section-title">SpaWhite + DayLight 5K System</h2>

    <p class="sec-body">
      The SpaWhite smile rejuvenation system combines a patented foam pad,
      carbamide peroxide gel, and the DayLight 5K LED light to create a fast,
      controlled whitening treatment. Each element plays a specific role:
    </p>

    <p class="section-body">
      <strong>Carbamide Peroxide&nbsp;|</strong>
      When pH-neutral carbamide peroxide mixes with moisture in the mouth, it
      releases hydroxyl radicals that gently penetrate the tooth structure and
      loosen stains that have built up over time.
    </p>

    <p class="section-body">
      <strong>Light&nbsp;|</strong>
      Exposing teeth and the suspended peroxide to the LED lights of the
      DayLight 5K accelerates the conversion of hydrogen peroxide into whitening
      hydroxyl radicals. The flexible mouth tray acts as a lens to focus and
      guide the light.
    </p>

    <p class="section-body">
      <strong>Pressure&nbsp;|</strong>
      Mild, even pressure is required to drive hydroxyl radicals into the
      enamel. Once the strip is seated in the flexible mouth tray, the tray
      conforms to the shape of the teeth to keep gel and tooth surfaces in
      close contact.
    </p>

    <p class="section-body">
      <strong>Heat&nbsp;|</strong>
      Gentle heat from the DayLight 5K light system further assists in
      releasing hydroxyl radicals. The light head is thermally stable and
      designed so the warmth is barely noticeable while still supporting an
      efficient reaction.
    </p>

    <p class="section-body">
      <strong>Exposure&nbsp;|</strong>
      Length of exposure is key to effective whitening. The SpaWhite /
      DayLight 5K system is engineered so a single, well-controlled session
      can noticeably brighten a smile in as little as 30 minutes.
